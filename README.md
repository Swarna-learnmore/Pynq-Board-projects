# Pynq-Board-projects
PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx® that makes it easier to use Xilinx platforms. Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors to build more capable and exciting electronic systems.

**What is PYNQ used for?**

It provides a set of integrated software and hardware components so that developer not only use existing components directly, but also adjust and extend functionality as needed. In summary, PYNQ accelerates the hardware/software co-design of embedded systems based on Zynq and improves the development productivity.

**Is PYNQ a FPGA?**

PYNQ (Python+Zynq), An FPGA development platform from Xilinx is an Open Source FPGA development platform.

**What are the advantages of PYNQ?**

Specifically, PYNQ enables architects, engineers and programmers who design embedded systems to use Zynq devices, without having to use ASIC-style design tools to design programmable logic circuits. PYNQ achieves this goal in three ways: Programmable logic circuits are presented as hardware libraries called overlays.

**What is the difference between PYNQ and Zynq?**

PYNQ stands for “Python Productivity for Zynq” an open-source software framework supporting Xilinx Zynq devices. The framework is a combination of Ubuntu and Python, which is very much loved by the development community. Zynq is an architecture that combines both FPGA with ARM Core into a single SOC.
